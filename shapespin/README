This sample shows how to make a PDK-based component that can live as an 
<object> inside a native JS/HTML application on webOS. The plugin 
exposes three methods: setRotationSpeed, pause, and resume. The Mojo 
application uses these methods to update the rotation of the shape based 
on a Mojo slider widget, and to stop and restart the animation when the 
card is put into the background.
